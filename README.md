# ⚙️ Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)

## 📘 Overview
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) integrate computation, networking, and physical processes.
Embedded computers and software monitor and control physical processes through feedback loops.

This repository provides learning materials, labs, models, and simulations for CPS education and research.
